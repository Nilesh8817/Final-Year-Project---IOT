# Accident Alert System

<p>In highly populated Countries, everyday people lose their lives because of accidents and poor
emergency facilities. These lives could have been saved if medical facilities are provided at the
right time. This project implies a system which is a solution to this drawback, when a vehicle
meets with an accident immediately a Vibration sensor will detect the signal, and sends it to
the Arduino microcontroller. Microcontroller will send an alert message through the GSM
modem including the location to the police station or a rescue team. So the police can
immediately trace the location through the GPS modem after receiving the information. The
proposed systems have been simulated and practically design by the use of hardware
components and the results are satisfied with the expectation.</p>
